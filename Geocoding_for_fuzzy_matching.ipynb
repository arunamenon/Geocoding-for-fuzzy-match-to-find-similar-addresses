    "# Geocoding for distance based fuzzy matching\n",
    "This tool helps match accounts/HCPs with each other based on distance between them. The tool uses geocodes from Open street maps (https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search) and US Census Bureau (https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/locations/onelineaddress). It finds distance between the addresses based on the [haversine distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)\n",

    "\n",
    "### How to use this tool?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensure all requisite packages are installed (permission is required from IT for installation)\n",

    " * re\n",
    " * requests \n",
    " * sys\n",

    "\n",
    "- The output of fuzzy matching tool for the dataset, filtered for the relevant matches (based on the match percentage, as per user discretion). Please see the documentation provided for details on the input file layout\n",
    "- The distance cutoff (between two addresses) to be used for flagging appropriate matches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Change the input and output directories in the variables 'path_to_input' and 'path_to_output' respectively. \n",
    "* Specify distance threshold in the variable 'distance_threshold'. (A default value of 0.18 km is used. Any two addresses having a distance less than the distance_threshold would be flagged as the same address.)\n",
